## Project Workflow

How effectively did you plan, execute, and present this project?

**1: Meets expectations**

**Comments**: Overall, I like your use of Trello, and your user stories would be
great, but a few suggestions:

* Once you've submitted your user stories, feel free to copy them into Trello,
and keep every card in trello a user story... this really helps keep your work
focused, and your user stories small. If you need to track sub-tasks, or non-dev
tasks, I put them in a separate list on the board for that app. You can also use
checklists on an individual user story card to help with this.
* Make sure your user stories have a ROLE, GOAL, and a REASON. E.g., "As a user,
I want to edit my posts so I can correct a mistake", or "As a user, I want to add
friends, so I can see their events and interact with them"
* Your ERD is a bit outdated, try to keep it up to date as your app progresses,
LucidChart or other digital tools are great for this. (Not a requirement, just a
  tip!)

## Technical Requirements

How well does your app demonstrate a grasp of the technologies introduced in class?

**2: Exceeds Expectations**

**Comments**: Great job here, your use of self-referential joins and has-many
through are well done, and in general your app is pretty complex for a project 2
submission!

## Creativity/Interface

How memorable and enjoyable to use is your app?

**1: Meets expectations**

**Comments**: App is generally well-designed and solves an interesting problem,
and the style is nice! Good job for just 1 week!

## Code Quality

Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

**1: Meets expectations**

**Comments**: In general, I saw a lot of improvement compared to P1, which is
great! Definitely room for improvement though (always is for me too!), so keep
at this. See my inline comments on the PR for more specifics, but in general,
I saw mostly issues with readability, specifically semantic variable names and
code structure / organization (e.g. using new lines to break up chunks)

## Deployment and Functionality

How accessible is your app to those who may want to explore it?

**1: Meets expectations**

**Comments**: In general, you did a good job here for the level of complexity,
but there are definitely ways in which you could polish this. For example, it
feels weird to me that there's not 'ownership' of events based on who created, it
just that I attend events automatically after creating them.

(Also, make sure to update the URL of your GH repo to point to the heroku location)
